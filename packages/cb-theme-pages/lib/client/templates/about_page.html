<h3>What is CodeBuddies.org?</h3>
<p>We're a community of people improving our web development and programming skills. Learning with others helps us learn faster. The project is free and <a href="https://github.com/lpatmo/codebuddies-platform" target="_blank">open-sourced.</a> </p>

<div id="faq-pay"></div>
<h3>Do I need to pay anything?</h3>
<p>No. It's free and safe space. We help each other out.</p>

<div id="faq-why"></div>
<h3>What's the inspiration behind CodeBuddies.org?</h3>
<p> The number of resources available online for anyone who wants to learn to code on their own is vast, but it can be quite frustrating for a beginner the first time they set up a development environment, touch the command line, fix a merge conflict in git, miss a semicolon, or find that a section of a tutorial they were following is outdated.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, <em>people</em> -- mentors, co-workers, hackathon buddies, and study partners -- are key to accelerating one's learning. But not everyone has access to study partners or mentors/co-workers who can help them.</p>

<div id="faq-who"></div>
<h3>Who can join?</h3>
<p>Anyone can sign up as long as you have an internet connection! You don't need to <em>be</em> or aspire to be a career programmer. Code literacy is for everyone.</p>

<h3>What should I do when I join one of the Google Hangouts?</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Turn off your video camera</strong> to save on bandwidth. </li>
<li>If everyone shares their screens, we can share our work and help each other out more easily. You can <strong>screen share</strong> by <img src="//codebuddies.org/images/icon-screenshare.png"/> clicking on the green icon on the left (and the first window that appears after that). Google Hangouts lets multiple people screen share at the same time.  </li>
<li><strong>At a study session tagged "SILENT HANGOUT",</strong> everyone turns off BOTH video and audio and works at their own pace on the topic proposed. Screenshare to share your progress, and use the chatroom to ask questions and help each other out. </li>
<li>At a non-silent hangout, feel free to use the microphone, or if everyone is on the same page of a tutorial, try <strong>taking turns talking through the code out loud.</strong> Give everyone a chance to speak and ask questions. </li>
</ol>

<h3>What makes CodeBuddies different from Stackoverflow or a course?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Our philosophy is peer-to-peer learning via Google Hangouts using audio and screen sharing. You learn from others, and also validate your understanding of web development or programming when you find yourself explaining concepts to others running into the same questions you once ran into.</li>
<li>Everyone at the hangout is chatting about a <em>specific</em> topic or tutorial determined by the person who proposed the 1 or 2-hour-long study session. </li>
<li>The experience may not be as rigorous as that of a coding bootcamp or paid course because meeting times are flexible; you can propose a series of hangouts to finish an entire free online book, but not everyone may stick with it until the end.</li>
<li> The topics and times for study sessions can be proposed by any member of the community. </li>
</ol>

<h3>What's the history behind CodeBuddies?</h3>
<p>Linda (<a href="http://bit.ly/1u7C0KQ">@lpnotes</a>) wanted to become a better web developer (and help others discover the joy of making things come alive on the internet, too). </p>
<p>CodeBuddies initially launched near the end of August 2014 as a set of Google Group mailing lists; the hangouts were proposed via individual google calendars. This setup was not ideal, since there was no way to see a list of all the upcoming hangouts, and one had to be invited to the Google Calendar in order to propose a new study session. The Google Group mailing lists did beget a lot of awesome knowledge sharing discussions, but there was no convenient way to search for them.</p>

<p>This platform (<a href="//hangouts.codebuddies.org">hangouts.codebuddies.org</a>) launched on January 1st, 2015 after at least 50 hangouts, one in-person meetup in NYC in October, some late Christmas-New Year's Eve week nights, and feedback from some smart people.</p> 

<h3>How do I help?</h3>
<p>The project is community-led and open-sourced, so check out the <a href="//github.com/lpatmo/codebuddies-platform" target="_blank">Github repo</a> if you want an "open-source contributor" badge to your title and are interested in fixing one of the <a href="#">bugs</a>. You can also <a href="//github.com/lpatmo/codebuddies-platform/issues" target="_blank">file a bug</a> yourself, or ask about a feature in the <a href="//gitter.im/lpatmo/codebuddies-hangouts" target="_blank">chatroom</a>.</p>

The best (and easiest) way to help, though, is to <a href="/submit">propose a study session</a>.


<h3>Special thanks to these folks for their feedback, participation, and/or inspiration:</h3>
